# Literature Review

There exist a number of studies that employ machine learning techniques to learn more about collisions on the road. However, many of them focus on features of the accident other than the accident severity.

For example, [one study by Daniel Wilson](https://medium.com/geoai/using-machine-learning-to-predict-car-accident-risk-4d92c91a7d57) used a gradient boosting model to predict accident risk, while [another study by Meraldo Antonio](https://towardsdatascience.com/live-prediction-of-traffic-accident-risks-using-machine-learning-and-google-maps-d2eeffb9389e) used DBSCAN clustering to make a [publicly accessible accident predictor](https://kteo7.pythonanywhere.com/) to determine where and when an accident may occur in London. In general there are many more studies that aim at predicting car accidents in the general sense instead of focusing on which ones will be serious enough as to cause at least one fatality. This is not a criticism: the threat posed by a car accident to a human is so great that predicting whether one may happen at all and acting to prevent it will of course save lives.

A few studies found did delve into factors that included accident severity. [A paper by Fang Zong and others](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2013/547904/) used an ordered probit model and a support vector machine to predict the seriousness of an accident and how long it would last, perhaps unsuprisingly finding a positive correlation between the two response variables. [Another study by Iair R](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-crash-severity-for-nz-road-accidents-6214117e73fb) used random forests and naive Bayes to classify car accidents as one of four levels of severity: no injury, minor, severe, or fatal. This is essentially the same sort of problem that my study aims to solve, but with added levels of classification in the response variable. The study used an artificial neural network as a benchmark for performance, which the random forest and naive Bayes approaches were not able to outperform.

# Future Study

The data used in this study often includes multiple observations for each car accident, usually one for each actor involved in the accident. This association between the observations was not incorporated into the statistical learning models, a change that would likely result in greater accuracy in prediction and detection.

Additionally, a dataset specifically designed for predictive purposes would also be of help. With current levels of technology and ubiquitous computing in cars, we can retrieve more data about the car before the crash. Were the wheels slipping? Were the brakes applied? Was there a sudden change in steering direction? What was the exact speed of the vehicle? None of these details were present in the dataset used for this study but could be very useful in the future.

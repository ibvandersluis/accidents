# Conclusion

In an effort to accurately predict fatal car accidents, this study applied statistical learning methods to a dataset of 285,000 UK accidents. After preparing the data, three models were fit to predict whether the observaton would lead to a fatal accident or not. The models used were K-Nearest Neighbours, logistic regression, and decision trees. This study found that a trade-off exists between detection accuracy, the number of fatal accidents detected out of the total that was present in the test set, and prediction accuracy, the number of correct predictions out of the total number of accidents that were predicted to be fatal. The various models fell at different points in this tradeoff, but the most balanced models appeared to be kNN and bagging with classification trees.

# Abstract

With road accidents causing the deaths of many humans around the globe every year, understanding the difference between fatal and non-fatal crashes is key in preventing loss of life on the road. This study examines a dataset of UK car accidents in order to train various supervised learning models at detecting fatal crashes. In the process, a trade-off is discovered between detection accuracy (the percentage of actual fatal accidents successfully classified) and prediction accuracy (the percentage of fatal accident predictions that were correct). The balace between these two is important as results with either a low detection accuracy or a low prediction accuracy are less useful. Of the models used in experiments, the ones that were most successful were a K-Nearest Neighbours model with k = 1, and a random forest of classification trees.
